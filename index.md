# Project Proposal Questions
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
There were numerous topics covered so far in my domain, though some have stood out as possible central topics for the quarter 2 project. One of these was a live discussion about the **energy market**. As the adoption of EV cars and charging technology accelerates in the San Diego region, so too will the demand for electricity. At an on-site excursion, we discussed the live energy market with a professional, learning about how utility companies, substations, generators, and chargers themselves interact with the market. Energy prices fluctuate throughout the day in accordance with energy supply and demand. Batteries and increased generator loads are applied to support the high demand and high prices of peak energy use times. Working on a project around this idea may prove interesting and beneficial for SDGE.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project**
A potential investigation for the quarter 2 project would be the identification and prediction of the most ideal and efficient locations for building electric vehicle charging stations. Not only can the model grow more and more complicated as desired, but we can improve the depth of output. We may additionally investigate the sort of chargers we should use in specific locations according to predicted local capacities and car models.

**What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I think the current approach laid out for us provides an informative and engaging introduction in EV and EVCS (electric vehicle charging station) infrastructure and energy modeling. I appreciate the physical workshops we are able to work with to get a material domain understanding atop the exploration of the data. Perhaps I would like to spend more time with the existing literature to provide direction on how to improve upon or innovate models related to the topic.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
In terms of methodological approaches, I think increased engagement into existing literature and research would be interesting, though it is very time consuming and can remove focus from the development process.
In terms of modeling techniques, I would be interested in learning about and utilizing both temporal and geospatial predictive analysis. Based on my current expectations for projects, I don't foresee using standard linear or classification models, so I would need to explore additional approaches. That being said, existing literature has pointed to the usage of ensemble ML models leveraging models such as random forests and gradient boosting. However, prior to leveraging these ML models, I first need to continue upon data exploration and investigating the various features useful for identifying and predicting efficient EVCSs.
